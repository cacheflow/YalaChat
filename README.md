# YaLa Academy

#### What is YaLa Academy?

YaLa Academy is a movement dedicated to empowering young Middle Easterners to lead their generation towards a better future, and they needed the ability for individuals to submit powerful content and communicate in a private, anonymous environment in order to increase peace advocacy. 

#### What was created?

My team and I created an anonymous chat app for the [Causeathon](http://www.hackforacause.com) in Santa Monica on July 26. The app consists of two parts: the chat app aspect and a Rails CRUD app with comment, picture and tagging features.

P.S. 
The latter is currently being revamped due to a massive attack from our pals in Russia. 

#### What was used?

BUILT WITH:

Node
Socket.io
and love

### How to Run

First thing you have to do is install NodeJS on your system. If you are a Windows or Mac user, you can visit [Node](nodejs.org) and download the installer. 

After you're doing installing you can continue to the next part my dear friend.

Install [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com) - This will manage the server.
Install [Socket.io](http://socket.io) - allows for real time communication between the front-end and back-end

After your amazing install fest, then run "npm install" from the terminal. This will download all of the needed dependencies. 

Lastly, run "node app.js" from the command line and visit localhost:8080 to see the app.
