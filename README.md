#### What is YaLa Academy?

YaLa Academy is a movement dedicated to empowering young Middle Easterners to lead their generation towards a better future, and they needed the ability for individuals to submit powerful content and communicate in a private, anonymous environment in order to increase peace advocacy. 

#### What was created?

My team and I created an anonymous chat app for the [Causeathon](http://www.hackforacause.com) in Santa Monica on July 26. The app consists of two parts: the chat app aspect and a Rails CRUD app with comment, picture and tagging features.

P.S. 
The latter is currently being revamped due to a massive attack from our pals in Russia. 

#### What was used?

BUILT WITH:

Node
Socket.io
and love
<br>
### How to Run

First thing you have to do is install NodeJS on your system. If you are a Windows or Mac user, you can visit [Node](nodejs.org) and download the installer. 

After you've installed, you're ready to continue on, my dear friend. 
<br> 
Install [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com) - This will manage the server.
Install [Socket.io](http://socket.io) - allows for real time communication between the front-end and back-end
<br>
After your amazing install fest, then run "npm install" from the terminal. This will download all of the needed dependencies. 
<br> 
Lastly, run "node app.js" from the command line and visit localhost:8080 to see the app.
